<h2>Voxel Vectors</h2>

<pre style="color:#000000;background-color:#EEEEEE">
Type Vec3I
    As Integer X, Y, Z
End Type
</pre>

This is a basic vector type for storing voxel coordinates in integers.  Many VoxelGFX functions take this type as a parameter and most common vector arithmetic operations are implemented into the type.
<br>For example:
<pre>
...
VSet Vec3I(1, 2, 3)
Var A = Vec3I(1, 1, 1)
VoxLine A, 10*A
...
</pre>

<h2>Volume Types</h2>

<pre style="color:#000000;background-color:#EEEEEE">
Enum VoxVolumeType
    Volume_Dynamic = 0
    Volume_Static = 1
    Volume_OffScreen = 2
End Enum
</pre>

Enumeration for volume types.
<br>- Dynamic volumes are used for drawing and rendering and maintain both OpenGl and system copies for fast updating.
<br>- Static volumes are optimized for rendering and use only OpenGl managed memory.  Static volumes perform extra hidden surface removal whenever they are changed thus slowing drawing but speeding rendering operations.
<br>- Off Screen volumes are optimized for drawing operations and use system memory only.

Type Vox_Volume As Integer

This type is used to reference volumes.
