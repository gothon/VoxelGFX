<h2>Initialization</h2>

GetGLProcAddressCast(X)

Sub VoxInit (GlExtFetch As Function(ByRef Proc As Const ZString) As Any Ptr, Flags As UInteger = 0)
</pre>

Initializes the library by loading OpenGL functions and setting up a default Voxel Screen.  GlExtFetch is the address of a function that will be called to retrieve the address of OpenGL functions. Flags may be one of the following:

<pre style="color:#000000;background-color:#EEEEEE">
VOXEL_SCREEN32
VOXEL_SCREEN64
VOXEL_SCREEN128
VOXEL_SCREEN256
VOXEL_SCREEN512
</pre>

If flags is VOXEL_SCREEN.Z then a default Z x Z x Z screen will be created.  The screen size can also be set by a later function.

<br><br>
<pre style="color:#000000;background-color:#EEEEEE">
Sub VoxScreenRes (Size As Vec3I, BackColor As UInteger = 0)
Sub VoxScreenRes (SizeX As Integer, SizeY As Integer, SizeZ As Integer, BackColor As UInteger = 0)
</pre>

Sets up a Voxel Screen of dimensions SizeX x SizeY x SizeZ.  If BackColor is specified it will set the default background color.  The background color can also be changed using the OpenGL function glClearColor.

<h2>Volume Creation</h2>

<pre style="color:#000000;background-color:#EEEEEE">
Function VoxNewVolume (T As VoxVolumeType = 0) As Vox_Volume
Function VoxNewVolume (Size As Vec3I, T As VoxVolumeType = 0) As Vox_Volume
Function VoxNewVolume (SizeX As Integer, SizeY As Integer, SizeZ As Integer, T As VoxVolumeType = 0) As Vox_Volume
</pre>

<pre style="color:#000000;background-color:#EEEEEE">
Sub VoxSizeVolume (Size As Vec3I)
Sub VoxSizeVolume (SizeX As Integer, SizeY As Integer, SizeZ As Integer)
